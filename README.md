CPSC-298 Heroes of Computing: Minorities in Computer Science, Interterm 2021, Chapman University 
Taught by: Elia Eiroa Lledo

This course allows students to study the amazing contributions of computer scientists from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in engineering.
It ia structures as a two-part seminar course. In part one, students learn about the critical contributions of minorities to Computer Science throughout history. In part two, they will be led through discussions on what the world of technology lacks regarding inclusion and diversity. Students will then discuss how we can change these things at Chapman and post-graduation in the workforce.
